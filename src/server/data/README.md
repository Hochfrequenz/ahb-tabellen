# AHB.db

The ahb.db file is the sqlite database file that contains the AHB data.
It was populated using the machine-readable Anwendungshandbuecher, scraped by kohlrahbi from `.docx` files.

It is created by the ahb.sql file in the database/sql folder.
You can find the way how to create the database [here](https://github.com/Hochfrequenz/machine-readable_anwendungshandbuecher/issues/336).
